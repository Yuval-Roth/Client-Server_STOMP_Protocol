final whistle 400 Well, what a way to kick off Group E! Germany sit at the bottom of the group following that defeat, while Japan are at the top with one win from one! Spain and Costa Rica are yet to play their corresponding fixture, but if the rest of the games are anything like this one, we're in for one hell of a treat, and a very competitive set of fixtures.
